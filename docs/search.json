For the division based on WEOG countries, one of the rows in Table 1 results in a difference (the sample size is significant at p&lt;.05 level). For the second variant country division by Mutkukhrisna et al., there are no differences to the reported division of countries.\n\n\n\n\nKrys, K., de Almeida, I., Wasiel, A., & Vignoles, V. L.

    "text": "When these two alternative attributions (WEOG and Mutkukhrisna et al., 2020) of countries across WEIRD/non-WEIRD divide are incorporated into the analysis of the main trends in the sample of music psychology studies, the outcome reported in Table 1 with the country division provided by Krys et al. provides largely identical patterns despite small fluctuations in the WEIRD/non-WEIRD division (non-WEIRD in Krys et al. is 23%, in WEOG 16%, and in Mutkukhrisna 12% in this data).\nTo put the differences in the actual variables of interest more precisely, there are 11 statistical comparisons (of counts or means) in Table 1. For the division based on WEOG countries, one of the rows in Table 1 results in a difference (the sample size is significant at p&lt;.05 level). For the second variant country division by Mutkukhrisna et al., there are no differences to the reported division of countries.",
